# TeslaCam Browser

This is a simple browser for TeslaCam recordings.  These are the files that are generated by Dashcam and [Sentry Mode](https://www.tesla.com/blog/sentry-mode-guarding-your-tesla) on [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com) vehicles.

To use this app, simply click the "Open..." button and browse to the ```TeslaCam``` folder (either by plugging the TeslaCam USB drive into your PC / Mac, or possibly accessing it as a network share over WiFi if supported).  It'll aggregate clips by date and present them on a calendar, and a dropdown list to select individual events on that date.

Basic video playback controls let you view all available cameras side-by-side.  Clicking on a video will open a file browser pointing to the source file.

## Hardware 3.0 (HW3)

It appears newer vehicles with HW3 encode video in HEVC / H-265 format, which Chrome seems unable to handle.  All you'll see are blank areas where the videos should be, and clicking "Play" will throw an error (visible on the debug console).

## tesla_dashcam

If you've installed [tesla_dashcam](https://github.com/ehendrix23/tesla_dashcam), you can use it to merge clips from the command-line using a folder path provided by TeslaCam Browser:

1. Select the date and event folder you'd like to merge in TeslaCam Browser
2. Click the "Copy" button; this will copy the folder path into the clipboard
3. Open a Terminal (macOS) or Command Prompt (Windows) and invoke tesla_dashcam (pasting the file path from the clipboard)
   `> tesla_dashcam "<paste_folder_here>"`
