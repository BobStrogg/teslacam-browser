# teslacam-browser

This is a simple browser for TeslaCam recordings.  These are the files that are generated by Dashcam and [Sentry Mode](https://www.tesla.com/blog/sentry-mode-guarding-your-tesla) on [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com) vehicles.

To use this app, simply click the "Open SavedClips..." button and browse to the ```TeslaCam/SavedClips``` folder (either by plugging the TeslaCam USB drive into your PC / Mac, or possibly accessing it as a network share over WiFi if supported).  It'll aggregate clips by date and present them on a calendar, and a dropdown list to select individual events on that date.

Basic video playback controls let you view all available cameras side-by-side.
